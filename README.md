# Project 3 Juicy Brick-Breaker
This project is a brick-breaker-style game where a ball is shot at bricks to accumulate a score. The project aims to add as many "juicy" features as possible to make the game satisfying and engaging. The base of this project was the video assignments to establish the basic features.

# Description
I tried to follow a retro vaporwave aesthetic for the project as I thought that aesthetic fit best. The player must launch a ball at bricks to eliminate all of the objects. Once eliminated, the player can move on to the next level. (You will not see me move on to the next level for time's sake as in my demonstration as I struggled.) The player has 3 lives. Once dead the player can view their score and try again to complete all 3 levels.

## Implementation
Random Brick Colors
  - the bricks that spawn have a random color. (there are 4 colors)
Highlight
  - the skull glows momentarily when hit
Fade and fall
  - When the brick is hit, it falls and fades away
Screen Shake
  - there is a screen shake for when the ball strikes
Sound
  - There is a sound effect for when the paddle, brick, wall, and death
Music
  - There is music for the game. I tried to sync the menu effects with the music
Particles
  - The walls and skull generate particles when hit
Comet trail
  - The ball has a comet trail that follows
Skull
  - The Paddle was redesigned into a skull, there is a spot for the ball to rest on the skull's forehead
  - The skull's eyes follow the ball
Background
  - Added a dystopian background for each level
